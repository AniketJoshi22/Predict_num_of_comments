# Predict no. of comments
In this we have build a regression model to predict number of comments on a post given various features like No. of Likes on that Page, Page Checkins, Length of Post,No. of Shares for Post etc.

In this we have done preprocessing by removing highly corelated features and normalizing their values. Then we have used various Boosting Algorithms to predict no. of comments.
